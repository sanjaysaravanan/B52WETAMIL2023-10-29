  1. sort:
    sort function affects the original array

  2. splice:
    Removes elements from an array and, if necessary, inserts new elements in their place, returning the deleted elements.

    @param start — The zero-based location in the array from which to start removing elements.

    @param deleteCount — The number of elements to remove.

    @returns — An array containing the elements that were deleted.

  3. slice:
    does not affect the original array
    Returns a copy of a section of an array. For both start and end, a negative index can be used to indicate an offset from the end of the array. For example, -2 refers to the second to last element of the array.

    @param start
    The beginning index of the specified portion of the array. If start is undefined, then the slice begins at index 0.

    @param end
    The end index of the specified portion of the array. This is exclusive of the element at the index 'end'. If end is undefined, then the slice extends to the end of the array.

  HTML: 

    Simple HTML DOM Structure:

      head:
        title
        link:
          icon
          self-closing
            <link ...attributes />
        script
        style
        meta:
      
      body:
        div
        span
        img:
          self -closing tags
          <img />
          <br /> --> go to next line
        a - anchor
        p - paragraph
        h - heading
        mark - highligthing

        list tags:
          ul ( un-ordered list ), ol ( ordered-list ), li (list item)
          list-style-type

        semantic tags:
          very similar to DIV, but they have a special meaning to inform the browser

          section, article, aside, nav, footer, header
        
        inline vs block elements

          inline --> an element which occupies only the width needed for it
          block --> an element which occupies the entire parent's width

          Tell Me what are block and inline elements,

            Block:
              div, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ol, ul
            
            Inline:
              span, a, img, mark

        table:
          table is used for representing data in a tabular form
          thead, tbody, th( column header ), tr ( table row ), td ( table data )
